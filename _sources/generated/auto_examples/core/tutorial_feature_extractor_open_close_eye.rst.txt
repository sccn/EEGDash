EEGDash Feature Extractor
==========================

EEGDash example for eyes open vs. closed classification.

This example uses the :mod:`eegdash` library in combination with PyTorch to develop a deep learning model for analyzing EEG data, specifically for eyes open vs. closed classification in a single subject.

1. **Data Retrieval Using EEGDash**: An instance of :class:`eegdash.api.EEGDashDataset` is created to search and retrieve an EEG dataset. At this step, only the metadata is transferred.

2. **Data Preprocessing Using BrainDecode**: This process preprocesses EEG data using Braindecode by reannotating events, selecting specific channels, resampling, filtering, and extracting 2-second epochs, ensuring balanced eyes-open and eyes-closed data for analysis.

3. **Creating train and testing sets**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets with balanced labels, converted into PyTorch tensors, and wrapped in DataLoader objects for efficient mini-batch training.

4. **Model Definition**: The model is a shallow convolutional neural network (ShallowFBCSPNet) with 24 input channels (EEG channels), 2 output classes (eyes-open and eyes-closed).

5. **Model Training and Evaluation Process**: This section trains the neural network, normalizes input data, computes cross-entropy loss, updates model parameters, and evaluates classification accuracy over six epochs.

Data Retrieval Using EEGDash
----------------------------

We instantiate :class:`eegdash.api.EEGDashDataset` to pull the experiment
metadata and build the dataset definition.

First we find one resting state dataset. This dataset contains both eyes open
and eyes closed data.

        cache_dir=cache_folder,

Data Preprocessing Using Braindecode
------------------------------------

[BrainDecode](https://braindecode.org/stable/install/install.html) is a
specialized library for preprocessing EEG and MEG data. In this dataset, there
are two key events in the continuous data: **instructed_toCloseEyes**, marking
the start of a 40-second eyes-closed period, and **instructed_toOpenEyes**,
indicating the start of a 20-second eyes-open period.

For the eyes-closed event, we extract 14 seconds of data from 15 to 29 seconds
after the event onset. Similarly, for the eyes-open event, we extract data
from 5 to 19 seconds after the event onset. This ensures an equal amount of
data for both conditions. The event extraction is handled by the custom
function :func:`eegdash.hbn.preprocessing.hbn_ec_ec_reannotation`.

Next, we apply four preprocessing steps in Braindecode:
1. **Reannotation** of event markers using :func:`eegdash.hbn.preprocessing.hbn_ec_ec_reannotation`.
2. **Selection** of 24 specific EEG channels from the original 128.
3. **Resampling** the EEG data to a frequency of 128 Hz.
4. **Filtering** the EEG signals to retain frequencies between 1 Hz and 55 Hz.

When calling the `preprocess` function, the data is retrieved from the remote
repository.

Finally, we use `create_windows_from_events` to extract 2-second epochs from
the data. These epochs serve as the dataset samples. At this stage, each
sample is automatically labeled with the corresponding event type (eyes-open
or eyes-closed). `windows_ds` is a PyTorch dataset, and when queried, it
returns labels for eyes-open and eyes-closed (assigned as labels 0 and 1,
corresponding to their respective event markers).

It’s always a good practice to verify that the data has been properly loaded
and processed. Here, we plot a single channel from one sample to ensure the
signal is present and looks as expected.

Creating training and test sets
-------------------------------

The code below creates a training and test set. We first split the data into
training and test sets using the **train_test_split** function from the
**sklearn** library. We then create a **TensorDataset** for the training and
test sets.

1. **Set Random Seed** – The random seed is fixed using
   `torch.manual_seed(random_state)` to ensure reproducibility in dataset
   splitting and model training.
2. **Extract Labels from the Dataset** – Labels (eye-open or eye-closed
   events) are extracted from windows or features, stored as a NumPy array,
   and printed for verification.
3. **Split Dataset into Train and Test Sets** – The dataset is split into
   training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using `train_test_split()`,
   ensuring balanced stratification based on the extracted labels.
4. **Convert Data to PyTorch Tensors** – The selected training and testing
   samples are converted into `FloatTensor` for input features and
   `LongTensor` for labels, making them compatible with PyTorch models.
5. **Create DataLoaders** – The datasets are wrapped in PyTorch DataLoader
   objects with a batch size of 10, enabling efficient mini-batch training and
   shuffling.

Check labels
------------

It is good practice to verify the labels and ensure the random seed is
functioning correctly. If all labels are 0s (eyes closed) or 1s (eyes open),
it could indicate an issue with data loading or stratification, requiring
further investigation.

input channels (EEG channels), 2 output classes (eyes-open and eyes-closed),

Model Training and Evaluation Process
-------------------------------------

This section trains the neural network using the Adamax optimizer, normalizes
input data, computes cross-entropy loss, updates model parameters, and tracks
accuracy across six epochs.

1. **Set Up Optimizer and Learning Rate Scheduler** – The `Adamax` optimizer
   initializes with a learning rate of 0.002 and weight decay of 0.001 for
   regularization. An `ExponentialLR` scheduler with a decay factor of 1 keeps
   the learning rate constant.
2. **Allocate Model to Device** – The model moves to the specified device
   (CPU, GPU, or MPS for Mac silicon) to optimize computation efficiency.
3. **Normalize Input Data** – The `normalize_data` function standardizes input
   data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation along
   the time dimension before transferring it to the appropriate device.
4. **Evaluates Classification Accuracy Over Six Epochs** – The training loop
   iterates through data batches with the model in training mode. It
   normalizes inputs, computes predictions, calculates cross-entropy loss,
   performs backpropagation, updates model parameters, and steps the learning
   rate scheduler. It tracks correct predictions to compute accuracy.
5. **Evaluate on Test Data** – After each epoch, the model runs in evaluation
   mode on the test set. It computes predictions on normalized data and
   calculates test accuracy by comparing outputs with actual labels.
