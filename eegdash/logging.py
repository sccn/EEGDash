"""Logging configuration for EEGDash.

This module sets up centralized logging for the EEGDash package using Rich for enhanced
console output formatting. It provides a consistent logging interface across all modules.

# Get the root logger

# --- This is the key part ---
# 1. Remove any handlers that may have been added by default
root_logger.handlers = []

# 2. Add your RichHandler
root_logger.addHandler(RichHandler(rich_tracebacks=True, markup=True))

# 3. Set the level for the root logger

# Now, get your package-specific logger. It will inherit the
# configuration from the root logger we just set up.
