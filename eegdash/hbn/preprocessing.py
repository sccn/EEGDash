    """Preprocessor to reannotate HBN data for eyes-open/eyes-closed events.

    This preprocessor is specifically designed for Healthy Brain Network (HBN)
    datasets. It identifies existing annotations for "instructed_toCloseEyes"
    and "instructed_toOpenEyes" and creates new, regularly spaced annotations
    for "eyes_closed" and "eyes_open" segments, respectively.

    This is useful for creating windowed datasets based on these new, more
    precise event markers.

    Notes
    -----
    This class inherits from :class:`braindecode.preprocessing.Preprocessor`
    and is intended to be used within a braindecode preprocessing pipeline.
