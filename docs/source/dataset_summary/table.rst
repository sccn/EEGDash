.. rubric:: EEG Datasets Table

The data in EEG-DaSh originates from a collaboration involving 25 laboratories, encompassing 27,053 participants. This extensive collection includes M-EEG data, which is a combination of EEG and MEG signals. The data is sourced from various studies conducted by these labs,
involving both healthy subjects and clinical populations with conditions such as ADHD, depression, schizophrenia, dementia, autism, and psychosis. Additionally, data spans different mental states like sleep, meditation, and cognitive tasks.

In addition, EEG-DaSh will incorporate a subset of the data converted from `NEMAR <https://nemar.org/>`__, which includes 330 MEEG BIDS-formatted datasets, further expanding the archive with well-curated, standardized neuroelectromagnetic data.
