EEG-Dash is a Python package designed to simplify access to and analysis of large-scale MEEG (EEG, MEG) datasets. It provides a high-level interface for querying and retrieving data from the EEG-DaSh data archive, as well as tools for feature extraction and analysis.

## Core Concepts

The `eegdash` package is built around a few core concepts:

-   **`EEGDash`**: The main entry point for interacting with the EEG-DaSh database. It provides methods for finding, adding, and updating metadata records.
-   **`EEGDashDataset`**: A PyTorch-compatible dataset class that represents a collection of EEG recordings. It allows for easy integration with machine learning and deep learning pipelines.
-   **Feature Extractors**: A set of classes and functions for extracting features from EEG signals. These are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to easily create and apply custom feature extraction pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with `eegdash`, you need to have Python > 3.9 installed. You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install eegdash
```

To verify the installation, open a Python interpreter and run:

```python
from eegdash import EEGDash
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to query the database and load a dataset:

```python
from eegdash import EEGDashDataset

# Find all recordings for a specific subject and task
ds = EEGDashDataset(
    dataset="ds005505",
    subject="NDARCA153NKE",
    task="RestingState",
    cache_dir="."
)

# The `ds` object is a braindecode dataset, which is a PyTorch dataset.
# You can now use it with a PyTorch DataLoader:
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

## Data Access

### Querying the Database

You can query the database using keyword arguments to `EEGDashDataset`, or by passing a raw MongoDB query.

**Keyword Arguments:**

```python
# Find all recordings for a list of subjects and a specific task
subjects = ["NDARCA153NKE", "NDARXT792GY8"]
ds = EEGDashDataset(
    dataset="ds005505",
    subject=subjects,
    task="RestingState",
    cache_dir="."
)
```

**Raw MongoDB Query:**

```python
# Use a raw MongoDB query for more advanced filtering
raw_query = {
    "dataset": "ds005505",
    "subject": {"$in": ["NDARCA153NKE", "NDARXT792GY8"]},
    "task": "RestingState"
}
ds = EEGDashDataset(query=raw_query, cache_dir=".")
```

### Automatic Caching

By default, EEGDash caches downloaded data under a single, consistent folder:

-   If `EEGDASH_CACHE_DIR` is set in your environment, that path is used.
-   Else, if MNEâ€™s `MNE_DATA` config is set, that path is used to align with other EEG tooling.
-   Otherwise, `.eegdash_cache` in the current working directory is used.

This means that data is only downloaded the first time it is accessed and is reused in subsequent runs.

## Feature Extraction

`eegdash` provides a powerful and flexible feature extraction pipeline. You can use the built-in feature extractors or create your own.

Here's an example of how to extract features from a dataset:

```python
from eegdash.features import extract_features
from eegdash.features.feature_bank import signal_mean, signal_std

# Define the features to extract
features = {
    "mean": signal_mean,
    "std": signal_std,
}

# Extract the features
feature_ds = extract_features(ds, features)

# The `feature_ds` object is a FeaturesConcatDataset, which can be converted
# to a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
df = feature_ds.to_dataframe()
```
