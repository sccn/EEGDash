        "EEGDash example for eyes open vs. closed classification.\n\nThe code below provides an example of using the *EEGDash* library in combination with PyTorch to develop a deep learning model for analyzing EEG data, specifically for eyes open vs. closed classification in a single subject.\n\n1. **Data Retrieval Using EEGDash**: An instance of *EEGDashDataset* is created to search and retrieve an EEG dataset. At this step, only the metadata is transferred.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing Using BrainDecode**: This process preprocesses EEG data using Braindecode by reannotating events, selecting specific channels, resampling, filtering, and extracting 2-second epochs, ensuring balanced eyes-open and eyes-closed data for analysis.\n\n3. **Creating train and testing sets**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets with balanced labels, converted into PyTorch tensors, and wrapped in DataLoader objects for efficient mini-batch training.\n\n4. **Model Definition**: The model is a shallow convolutional neural network (ShallowFBCSPNet) with 24 input channels (EEG channels), 2 output classes (eyes-open and eyes-closed).\n\n5. **Model Training and Evaluation Process**: This section trains the neural network, normalizes input data, computes cross-entropy loss, updates model parameters, and evaluates classification accuracy over six epochs.\n"

        "## Data Preprocessing Using Braindecode\n\n[BrainDecode](https://braindecode.org/stable/install/install.html) is a specialized library for preprocessing EEG and MEG data. In this dataset, there are two key events in the continuous data: **instructed_toCloseEyes**, marking the start of a 40-second eyes-closed period, and **instructed_toOpenEyes**, indicating the start of a 20-second eyes-open period.\n\nFor the eyes-closed event, we extract 14 seconds of data from 15 to 29 seconds after the event onset. Similarly, for the eyes-open event, we extract data from 5 to 19 seconds after the event onset. This ensures an equal amount of data for both conditions. The event extraction is handled by the custom function **hbn_ec_ec_reannotation**.\n\nNext, we apply four preprocessing steps in Braindecode:\n1.\t**Reannotation** of event markers using hbn_ec_ec_reannotation().\n2.\t**Selection** of 24 specific EEG channels from the original 128.\n3.\t**Resampling** the EEG data to a frequency of 128 Hz.\n4.\t**Filtering** the EEG signals to retain frequencies between 1 Hz and 55 Hz.\n\nWhen calling the **preprocess** function, the data is retrieved from the remote repository.\n\nFinally, we use **create_windows_from_events** to extract 2-second epochs from the data. These epochs serve as the dataset samples. At this stage, each sample is automatically labeled with the corresponding event type (eyes-open or eyes-closed). windows_ds is a PyTorch dataset, and when queried, it returns labels for eyes-open and eyes-closed (assigned as labels 0 and 1, corresponding to their respective event markers).\n\n"
